# Entropy-directed scheduling (EDS)

* This is the implementation of Entropy-directed scheduling (EDS) algorithm for FPGA high-level synthesis (HLS). Our work has been contributed to ICCD 2018 and TCAD.
* Benchmarks for our experiments can be downloaded at https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/EXPRESS/benchmark/ or you can just download from our repo.
* Execution details can be found in `main.cpp`. You should put "Benchmarks" and the programs in the same folder by default.
* Use `cmd` to pass the arguments into our programs.
